# Admin Dashboard
A solution to the assignment from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/home). The purpose of this assignment was to practice and learn capabilities of CSS Grid, so most of the layout is made by using this technology. In addition support for mobile and small screens was implemented. You can view the project [here](https://st33ze.github.io/admin-dashboard/) or check github pages.
